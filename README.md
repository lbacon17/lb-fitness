# **[LB Fitness](https://lb-fitness.herokuapp.com/)**

![](libraries/readme_images/site_responsiveness.png)

Welcome to LB Fitness. This application exists to give users actionable fitness advice by providing subscription-based content, and also gives them the opportunity to buy merchandise. It offers subscriptions suitable to both beginners and more experienced, advanced individuals and aims to create a community of users who are passionate about fitness. With this application, members will have a platform to comment on its content, offer an exchange of opinions, and monitor each other's progress.

The website serves the following core purposes:

1. Sell subscriptions with which members can access training content that they can use to reach their goals
1. Invite users with a passion for fitness to form a community and talk to each other as much as possible
1. Sell fitness-related products to its key target market

Anyone can purchase a product from the store without even registering for an account, but users need an account to subscribe to the app (become a member). Creating an account is free, but this does not give the user a subscription. A user must decide which subscription plan to buy before becoming a member. The breakdown of the type of user is therefore as follows:

* **Guests**: can place an order from the store and submit a contact request - no account needed
* **Registered users**: can place an order from the store and save their contact details and delivery information for future orders - account needed but no subscription needed
* **Members**: can access exclusive video content and interact with each other - account and subscription needed

The app would be of interest to:

* Fitness beginners who would benefit from walkthroughs and tutorials to help them feel more confident in their training
* Fitness enthusiasts with a little experience who can still benefit from a little guidance
* People who are passionate about fitness and enjoy meeting and communicating with like-minded people
* People who love talking about fitness and sharing their opinions
* Regular consumers of fitness merchandise, including clothing, prepped meals, supplements and accessories

This application was inspired by one of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)'s project ideas: **build a fitness subscription application**.

The deployed website is available [here](https://lb-fitness.herokuapp.com/).

### UX

#### Design

The website is mainly based on Bootstrap's grid layout, and makes use of a number of Bootstrap's components and built-in classes, such as the navbar, buttons and spacing rules. The design mixes vibrant and muted colours in order to stand out to the user but remain easy on the eye and make the website as intuitive and easy to navigate as possible. To new and unauthenticated users, the site's primary purpose as a subscription application is immediately obvious with the background image, the chunky, shadowed callout text and the large call-to-action button inviting the user to subscribe. The choice of font 'RocknRoll One' gives the site a fun feel without appearing comical.

Datasets consist of one item per row on extra small screens, one or two items per row on small screens, 2 or 3 items per row on medium screens, 3 items per row on large screens, and 3 or 4 items per row on extra large screens. Any page or app with potentially varying amounts of data is fully responsive at all screen sizes and the site's structural integrity is not harmed. Data pertaining to user history or key information is formatted in a table to make information easily accessible to the user.

User feedback is clear, with messages appearing in a card at the top left of the screen (top centre on mobile devices with reduced font sizes for optimal user-friendliness). The user is immediately notified of the nature of the message by the background colour of the card title - a green colour indicates a success message i.e. the user has successfully performed and completed an action, a red colour indicates an error message, yellow indicates a warning to the user and blue simply indicates some information that the user may wish to be aware of. All messages are dismissible with a click of the 'x' in the top-right corner of the card, so that the user does not have to keep reading the message once it has been acknowledged.

All delete actions initiated by the user that will result in data being permanently deleted trigger a modal pop-up box, asking the user to confirm that they really want to delete something in the event that they mistakenly clicked that button. The user can select cancel, marked with a more neutral grey background, if they do not wish to delete a piece of data, or confirm, which will initiate the deletion process. Note that this does not apply to a user removing an item from their shopping cart, as the item will still be retrievable in the store and the user can re-add it if they wish. Asking the user to confirm every individual action may frustrate them and unnecessarily slow down their navigation of the app. All buttons that perform a delete action have a red background.

Forms on the website utilise the django-crispy-forms package for maximum responsiveness. Those that also require card payment use Stripe Elements for authorisation and payment processing.

#### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to design wireframes for this application. They can be viewed [here](libraries/wireframes). Note that these wireframes were mostly drawn up prior to creating the project's repository, so the actual content and layout may appear markedly different in places.

### Features

#### Existing features

##### For all users

* A responsive fixed navbar displaying with the ability to navigate to all the site's main pages, register for an account, log in/out and view the total value of the user's shopping cart
    * The main navbar is accessible via a hamburger menu in the top left of the viewport on mobile and tablet devices
* A search bar for the store in which users can input text and find items whose names contain the search string
    * If no products are found, a button to view all products appears in the middle of the page to redirect the user back to the shop's main page
* A call to action button on the homepage that invites the user to subscribe and takes them to the subscribe page, where they can choose one of three packages
    * If a user selects a subscription to purchase, they must log in before being redirected to the checkout page for that subscription
* A shop page displaying all items in store and the total number of items
    * In the shop dropdown menu, the user can select individual categories which filters the items and only shows those belonging to the category in the link. The number of items shown updates accordingly
* A sorting box above the shop items for the user to sort by name, price and rating, in both ascending and descending order
* An image of each product in the store with its name, price, category and rating below. The user can click the image to be taken to that product's individual page where they can select the size (if applicable) and quantity of the item before adding it to their cart
* A continue shopping button on each product's individual page to take the user back to the main shop page
* An add to cart button below each product on the shop's main page that triggers a modal for the user to select size and quantity. This is more user-friendly than trying to fit a quantity form and size selector below each item.
* A contact form that users can fill out to submit a query and receive a confirmation e-mail that their request has been received.
* A real-time cart total that can be clicked on to bring up a preview of the items in the user's cart
* A cart page that lists all the items in the user's cart and keeps a running subtotal, and calculates the total, delivery, grand total, and how much more the user can spend to get free delivery
    * The user can also update the quantity of an item in their cart on this page, or remove it from their cart entirely
* A checkout page where the user enter their billing and shipping information, and check out securely using Stripe
* A footer that displays social media icons, copyright info and 'Contact Us' text, that takes the user back to the contact page
* A pop up box providing user feedback depending on the action taken e.g. adding an item to the cart triggers a success message that a specified quantity of an item in a certain size was added to the user's cart
* Validation errors that appear in red if a field in a form is not filled out correctly
* A 404 page that is rendered if the user enters an invalid URL
* An automatic redirect to the login page using the @login_required decorator if the user attempts to access a URL that only logged in users can see
* An automatic redirect to the home page if the user attempts to access a URL that they are not authorised to view

##### For registered users

* A user dashboard where the user can see their current subscriptions (if any)
* A profile page where the user can view and update their account details and their order history, and delete their account
* A link in each order of the user's order history that takes the user to a page where they can view an order in more detail
* A form for updating the user's account details
* A checkbox when checking out with a susbcription or shop order that the user can check to save their information to their profile for future orders

##### For members (paid subscribers)

* A videos page where the user can view the training videos available to members
    * Each video comes with a title, duration, rating and description
* Certain videos are only available to premium members, depending on the boolean value of the premium field in the Video model
    * Basic plan members are redirected back to the main videos page if attempting to manually access a URL for a premium video with an error message that they must purchase a premium or VIP package to be able to view these
* A search bar at the top of the videos page in which users can input text and find videos whose titles or descriptions contain the search string
    * A filter is in place so that the search will never return premium videos to basic members
* A sorting box above the videos for the member to sort by title, length and rating, in both ascending and descending order
* An individual page for each video, including a comments section for members to leave comments and interact with other members
    * Comments must be approved by an administrator and are visible to other members once approved
    * Before the comments thread, the number of total comments is shown and updates in real time when a comment is approved or deleted
* The opportunity for users to edit and delete their approved comments
    * If a member edits their comment, it must be approved again before others can see it
* VIP members receive 50% off in the store and free delivery on all orders
    * On the shop page, an item's usual price is struck through with a line and the VIP's discounted price is shown

##### For administrators (superusers)

* A button to add videos or store items on the videos and shop pages respectively
* An admin panel page where the administrator can also perform the above two actions
* The ability to approve or reject comments made by other users
* The ability to edit or delete comments made by other users, in case of inappropriate content
* A modal trigger that asks the administrator to confirm whether they wish to delete or reject a comment, with a cancel button in case they mistakenly selected this option

#### Features left to implement

* Pagination for shop products, videos, comments and user order history to limit the number of items on each page so that the user doesn't have to scroll too far to locate a record
    * The user could also choose how many search results they would like per page, e.g. 20, 50, 100
* The ability for users to add store items to their favourites and have these rendered on the shop page.
* The ability for users to freeze, unfreeze, upgrade or downgrade subscriptions
    * Freezing a subscription would simply set the active field in the Subscription model to false, and the user would not have access to the materials in this time
    * Unfreezing the subscription would set the active field back to true, and the user would be able to access the materials again
* A product review system on each product page where users could leave a descriptive review and a rating of a product
    * These would be laid out in the same way as video comments, with an administrator having to approve or reject a review
    * Each review could also have like/dislike buttons so that users could sort reviews by helpfulness 
* A forum where users can interact with each other, share their progress and even engage in general chat
    * This is a more comfortable space for genuine user interaction than the comments section of a video
* A like and dislike button on each video comment that members can click to show their approval or disapproval at another person's comment
    * It could then be possible to sort comments on a video by the number of likes received
* A recurring payment system where paid subscribers are automatically charged at the end of each billing cycle
* The ability to publicly view other user/member profiles and their contribution history
    * Other users/members may wish to hide potentially sensitive data such as e-mail addresses from other users, so they could have the option to not allow this to be seen by others
* A private messaging function that would enable users to communicate with each other on the app itself
* An FAQs page that a user could read before potentially submitting a contact form with a query already asked many times
* A more personalised and interesting custom 404 page

### Credits and Acknowledgements

#### Content

The shop, cart and checkout applications are based heavily on the materials provided in the [Boutique Ado](https://github.com/ckz8780/boutique_ado_v1/) project in the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module, delivered by [Chris Z. (ckz8780)](https://github.com/ckz8780/). Much of the software written for these applications draws on this project's source code and follows a similar structure, while some chunks such as the webhooks and JavaScript logic for handling secure payments are directly lifted. Credit should be given to Chris where this is the case.

The star ratings feature on the videos page followed the instructions of this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1GB_q5txM/).

The website uses a number of components from Bootstrap, such as the navbar, card panels and buttons. The site's icons also come from Font Awesome.

The sample training videos are free-to-use videos taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/gym/). The product images come from [Lululemon](https://shop.lululemon.com/) (clothing and apparel), [Muscle Food](https://www.musclefood.com/) (meal prep and supplements) and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) (accessories). If the copyright owners of these images wish to have them removed, please e-mail me at louis.bacon17@gmail.com or use the app's [Contact Form](https://lb-fitness.herokuapp.com/contact/) to submit a takedown request.

#### Special Thanks

I would like to give special thanks to the Tutors at Code Institute, in particular Alan, Kevin, Scott, Johann and Michael, and members of CI's [Slack](https://slack.com) channel, who supported me tirelessly on some very tricky issues and helped me get to the bottom of them. I would also like to thank my mentor [Precious Ijege](https://ng.linkedin.com/in/precious-ijege-908a00168) for his constant support with the project and always challenging me to find ways to further improve it.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy using the app.
