### Responsiveness

The website was tested in Google Chrome using the Viewport Resizer extension, Chrome DevTools and the Responsive Design Checker.

The website's layout was tested pixel by pixel and on all popular mobile and tablet devices. The design is consistently responsive at all screen sizes and there is no change in the appearance or performance of interactive features.

No issues, major or minor, were found.

### Browser Compatibility

The application was tested in the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Brave Browser
* Opera
* Safari

The application proved itself highly compatible with all browsers and performance was consistent across the board. Only one minor issue was noted:

Smooth scroll behaviour is not supported on Safari, meaning the page jumps right back to the top when the return to top button is clicked as opposed to a smooth scrolling motion. This is due to Safari not supporting the scroll-behavior: smooth CSS property.
I tried various JavaScript solutions to remedy this, but none of them had any effect, and some even hindered the app's performance. As this is a relatively minor issue, I decided not to take any further action at this stage.
